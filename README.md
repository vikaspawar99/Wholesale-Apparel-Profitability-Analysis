Wholesale Apparel Profitability Analysis (FY 2024–25)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes profitability drivers in a wholesale apparel business over a full fiscal year (April 2024 – March 2025).
The goal is to move beyond revenue tracking and identify which products, customers, and regions truly generate profit, enabling better business decisions.

🎯 Business Objective

Understand profit contribution across products, customers, and regions

Identify margin stability and concentration risks

Support management with data-driven insights for sustainable growth

❓ Business Problem

Despite consistent sales volumes, the business lacked clarity on:

Which products are actually profitable

Whether high revenue equals high profit

Which customers and regions drive most of the profit

🔍 Key Insights

Gujarat contributes the majority of total profit

Gross margins remain stable at approximately 26%

Formal pants are the highest profit-generating category

Ahmedabad is the top profit-generating city

A small group of customers drives a large share of total profit

High revenue does not always translate to high profitability

💡 Recommendations

Prioritize high-margin product categories (Formal, Linen)

Strengthen relationships with top profit-contributing customers

Re-evaluate pricing for high-volume, low-margin accounts

Reduce regional concentration risk by expanding into higher-margin markets

✅ Outcome

This project demonstrates a structured Business Analyst approach:
